## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Read the dataset from the URL
data <- read.csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data")

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(data)

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Bachelors, fill = X..50K)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Education Level", y = "Proportion", fill = "Income") +
  theme_minimal()

```
What is the average working hours per week for different income levels?

```{r}
aggregate(X40 ~ X..50K, data = data, mean)

```

```{r}
data$Adm.clerical <- as.factor(data$Adm.clerical) # Ensuring the occupational data is treated as a categorical variable
ggplot(data, aes(x = Adm.clerical, y = X77516, fill = Male)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Occupation", y = "Income") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
